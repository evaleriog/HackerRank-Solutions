//A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.
//        The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful. Determine the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.
//        For example, there are  prisoners and  pieces of candy. The prisoners arrange themselves in seats numbered  to . Let's suppose two is drawn from the hat. Prisoners receive candy at positions . The prisoner to be warned sits in chair number .
//        Function Description
//        Complete the saveThePrisoner function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the chair number of the prisoner to warn.
//        saveThePrisoner has the following parameter(s):
//        n: an integer, the number of prisoners
//        m: an integer, the number of sweets
//        s: an integer, the chair number to begin passing out sweets from
//        Input Format
//        The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of test cases.
//        The next  lines each contain  space-separated integers:
//        - : the number of prisoners
//        - : the number of sweets
//        - : the chair number to start passing out treats at
//        Constraints
//
//
//
//
//        Output Format
//        For each test case, print the chair number of the prisoner who receives the awful treat on a new line.
//        Sample Input 0
//        2
//        5 2 1
//        5 2 2
//        Sample Output 0
//        2
//        3
//        Explanation 0
//        In first query, there are  prisoners and  sweets. Distribution starts at seat number . Prisoners in seats numbered  and  get sweets. Warn prisoner .
//        In the second query, distribution starts at seat  so prisoners in seats  and  get sweets. Warn prisoner .
//        Sample Input 1
//        2
//        7 19 2
//        3 7 3
//        Sample Output 1
//        6
//        3
//        Explanation 1
//        In the first test case, there are  prisoners,  sweets and they are passed out starting at chair . The candies go all around twice and there are  more candies passed to each prisoner from seat  to seat .
//        In the second test case, there are  prisoners,  candies and they are passed out starting at seat . They go around twice, and there is one more to pass out to the prisoner at seat .
